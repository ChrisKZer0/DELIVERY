FLOWCHARTS (Delivery) – Client and Server

In this repository I included two flowcharts related to the process of ordering food through a delivery app. 
At first, I didn’t fully understand the instructions, so I started by making the flowchart from the client’s perspective, showing how a person enters the app, chooses what they want, and completes the order.

Later, to complement it and understanding the activity better, I also made the server flowchart, where I show what happens internally in the platform when an order arrives: validation, preparation, and delivery.
The idea of having both is to see the complete process from both sides. Each flowchart helps me understand how an order works in an app like DiDi, both from the outside and the inside.
